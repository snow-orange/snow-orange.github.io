      <h1>Exploring the absolute wonder of Hungary</h1>

      <p>
        As I was wondering down the colourful street of Arany Janos in a
        daydream, the delicious smell of Hungary’s goulash paralysed me. The
        secret spice seasoning smoothly spread flowed out of the masterpiece and
        through my senses instantly summoning me in an unbreakable force. The
        town of Szentkiralyszabadja, and Ensana Grand Margaret Island hotel. I
        am going to tell you what it was like to meet these places when
        exploring the absolute wonder of Hungary.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the first day I decided to fly out of the streets of Arany Janos and
        land in Szentkiralyszabadja: the haunted town. Szentkiralyszabadja is
        the most haunted place in Hungary, temperature at 13°C giving the whole
        place a look of a home for paranormal activity. I soon later found out
        that this creepy but fascinating buildings were built for the soldiers
        in 1960 to 1989. As I stepped out of the plane the cold instantly froze
        me as I felt my veins turn into ice, I could see a building all
        deserted, I smelled waste in the building, and it was a horrible smell
        of a combination of plastic, dust, and overgrown grass. The town,
        Szentkiralyszabadja, has been left abandoned for more than 2 years, all
        the towns walls are peeled and cracked, obviously no one wanting to even
        step foot in the land of Szentkiralyszabadja and fix them.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the thrilling adventure of Szentkiralyszabadja, we can have a
        tremendous rest at a wondrous, colourful, busy restaurant called Retro
        goulash & langosh bar where the most famous food in Hungary is served:
        Goulash. It is a stew with meat that explodes with flavour when bit in,
        soft potato full of flavour that when you look at them you can almost
        taste the flavour and flaming seasoning balanced right between
        not-so-spicy and drinking-the-whole-pacific-ocean-spicy.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a long day of exploring, I was exhausted, so I booked a grand
        hotel: Ensana grand margaret island. This hotel is the grandest hotel
        you can find in Hungary. With an indoor pool with a magnificent painting
        and a view of the outside nature, food put in front of you to pick from,
        and amazing service for you, with this, you cannot disagree with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later I left Hungary after I had the biggest experience of my life, with
        only one conclusion left to express, Hungary is the best holiday
        destination on this planet to ever exist. To the warm welcoming smell of
        Hungary’s Goulash which summon people, to the cold deserted sense of
        Szentkiralyszabadja which people are too scared to enter: Hungary is
        absolutely, undenying, totally the most breath-taking place of them all
        of them.
